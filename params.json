{"name":"pprepair","body":"## What is pprepair?\r\n\r\npprepair (planar partition repair) takes a set of polygons and ensures that they form a valid planar partition, made of valid polygons and having no gaps or overlaps. It can be used as a validator, telling of problems in individual polygons or in the planar partition, and also as an automatic repair tool, outputting a set of polygons that do form a valid planar partition.\r\n\r\n## How do I use pprepair?\r\n\r\npprepair is a command-line program, which we provide as source code, together with makefiles for Mac and Linux. We plan on offering binaries (including for Windows) in the future. To compile pprepair, you first need to install the free libraries [CGAL](http://www.cgal.org) and [OGR](http://www.gdal.org/ogr/). Afterwards use one of the included makefiles.","tagline":"Validate and automatically repair planar partitions","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
